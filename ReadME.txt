SpinXEngine Project Architecture Explained
Project Structure Overview
The SpinXEngine solution follows a clean, layered architecture pattern with four main projects:
1.	SpinXEngine.Api: Web API project that exposes endpoints for gaming functionalities
2.	SpinXEngine.Core: Business logic layer that implements game mechanics and player services
3.	SpinXEngine.Repository: Data access layer that handles MongoDB operations
4.	SpinXEngine.Common: Shared utilities, models, and configuration helpers
Detailed Project Breakdown

SpinXEngine.Common (.NET 8.0)
This project serves as a foundation containing shared utilities and configuration management:
•	Dependencies: Uses Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration packages (v9.0.5) for loading and managing configuration
•	Key Components:
•	ConfigurableSettings: Static class that loads settings from appsettings.json, particularly MongoDB connection string and game settings
•	Contains shared models and helper classes used across other projects

SpinXEngine.Repository (.NET 8.0)
This project handles data persistence using MongoDB:
•	Dependencies:
•	MongoDB.Driver (v2.22.0) for MongoDB operations
•	Microsoft.Extensions.Options (v9.0.5) for configuration options
•	References SpinXEngine.Common for shared models
•	Key Components:
•	SpinXEngineDbContext: Manages MongoDB database connections and collections
•	Repository<T>: Generic repository pattern implementation with CRUD operations
•	PlayerRepository: Specialized repository for player data with specific operations like balance updates
•	RepositoryServices: Static class with dependency injection configuration for repositories and MongoDB settings

SpinXEngine.Core (.NET 8.0)
This project implements game logic and business rules:
•	Dependencies:
•	Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Client (v19.225.1)
•	References SpinXEngine.Repository for data access
•	Key Components:
•	SpinGame: Implements slot game mechanics including reel symbol generation and win calculations
•	IWinCalculationStrategy: Strategy pattern for different win calculation methods (LineWinStrategy, ZigzagWinStrategy)
•	PlayerService: Business service for player operations (balance management, spinning, etc.)
•	CoreServices: Static class for configuring dependency injection of core services

SpinXEngine.Api (.NET 8.0)
This project exposes HTTP endpoints for the game functionality:
•	Dependencies:
•	log4net (v3.1.0) for logging
•	Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning (v5.1.0) for API versioning
•	Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore (v8.0.0)
•	Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (v6.6.2) for Swagger documentation
•	References SpinXEngine.Core for business logic
How It All Works Together
1.	Configuration Flow:
•	ConfigurableSettings in Common project loads settings from appsettings.json
•	These settings are used to configure MongoDB connection and game parameters
2.	Dependency Injection Setup:
•	API startup configures services using CoreServices.ConfigureDependencies()
•	CoreServices calls RepositoryServices.ConfigureDependencies() to set up data access
•	Services are registered with appropriate lifecycles (Singleton, Scoped, Transient)
3.	Data Access Pattern:
•	SpinXEngineDbContext provides MongoDB connection and collection access
•	Generic Repository<T> implements standard CRUD operations
•	Specialized repositories like PlayerRepository add domain-specific operations
4.	Game Mechanics:
•	SpinGame class generates random reel symbols in a matrix (default 3×5)
•	Win calculation uses strategy pattern with different algorithms:
•	LineWinStrategy: Checks for matching symbols in horizontal lines
•	ZigzagWinStrategy: Checks for matching symbols in zigzag patterns
5.	Player Management:
•	PlayerService handles player operations (creating accounts, balance management)
•	Integrates with game logic to process spins and update player balances
6.	API Layer:
•	Controllers expose RESTful endpoints for player operations and game functionality
•	Uses log4net for logging and Swagger for API documentation
•	Employs API versioning for backward compatibility
Technical Implementation Details
1.	MongoDB Integration:
•	Uses official MongoDB.Driver with connection settings from configuration
•	Repository pattern abstracts database operations
•	Singleton DbContext ensures connection pooling
2.	Game Algorithm:
•	Game uses a matrix representation (3×5 by default) of slot machine reels
•	Random number generation for symbol placement
•	Modular win calculation strategies that can be extended
3.	Dependency Injection:
•	Follows best practices with appropriate service lifetimes
•	Clear separation between interfaces and implementations
•	Configuration injection through IOptions pattern
This architecture demonstrates modern .NET 8 development practices with clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, and modular design that allows for easy extension and maintenance.
